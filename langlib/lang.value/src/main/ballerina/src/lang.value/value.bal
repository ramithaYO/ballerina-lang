# A type parameter that is a subtype of `anydata`.

# all uses in the declaration must refer to same type.

type AnydataType anydata;

# Returns a clone of `v`.
# A clone is a deep copy that does not copy immutable subtrees.
# A clone can therefore safely be used concurrently with the original.
# It corresponds to the Clone(v) operation,
# defined in the Ballerina Language Specification.
#
# + v - source value
# + return - clone of `v`

# Constructs a value with a specified type by cloning another value.
# + v - the value to be cloned
# + t - the type for the cloned to be constructed
# + return - a new value that belongs to `t`, or an error if this cannot be done
#
# When `v` is a structural value, the inherent type of the value to be constructed
# comes from `t`. When `t` is a union, it must be possible to determine which
# member of the union to use for the inherent type by following the same rules
# that are used by list constructor expressions and mapping constructor expressions
# with the contextually expected type. If not, then an error is returned.
# The `constructFrom` operation is recursively applied to each member of `v` using
# the type descriptor that the inherent type requires for that member.
#
# Like the Clone abstract operation, this does a deep copy, but differs in
# the following respects:
# - the inherent type of any structural values constructed comes from the specified
#   type descriptor rather than the value being constructed
# - the read-only bit of values and fields comes from the specified type descriptor
# - the graph structure of `v` is not preserved; the result will always be a tree;
#   an error will be returned if `v` has cycles
# - immutable structural values are copied rather being returned as is; all
#   structural values in the result will be mutable, except for error values
#   (which are always immutable)
# - numeric values can be converted using the NumericConvert abstract operation
# - if a record type descriptor specifies default values, these will be used
#   to supply any missing members

# - if `v` is boolean, then the string `true` or `false`
# - if `v` is an int, then return `v` represented as a decimal string
# - if `v` is a float or decimal, then return `v` represented as a decimal string,
#   with a decimal point only if necessary, but without any suffix indicating the type of `v`;
#   return `NaN`, `Infinity` for positive infinity, and `-Infinity` for negative infinity
# - if `v` is a list, then returns the results toString on each member of the list
#   separated by a space character
# - if `v` is a map, then returns key=value for each member separated by a space character
# - if `v` is xml, then returns `v` in XML format (as if it occurred within an XML element)
# - if `v` is table, TBD
# - if `v` is an error, then a string consisting of the following in order
#     1. the string `error`
#     2. a space character
#     3. the reason string
#     4. if the detail record is non-empty
#         1. a space character
#         2. the result of calling toString on the detail record
# - if `v` is an object, then
#     - if `v` provides a `toString` method with a string return type and no required methods,
#       then the result of calling that method on `v`
#     - otherwise, `object` followed by some implementation-dependent string
# - if `v` is any other behavioral type, then the identifier for the behavioral type
#   (`function`, `future`, `service`, `typedesc` or `handle`)
#   followed by some implementation-dependent string

# that are not equal (in the sense of the `==` operator).

# A value of type `table` is converted into a list of
